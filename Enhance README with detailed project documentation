# ITC-Hotels-Revenue-Optimization-PowerBI
🔹 Project Overview
This project is a comprehensive Power BI dashboard designed to analyze and optimize
revenue performance for a luxury hospitality business inspired by ITC Hotels.
The dashboard provides deep insights into financial performance, occupancy trends,
room category contribution, booking behavior, and cancellation patterns over a
three-month period.
The primary objective is to enable data-driven decision-making for hotel management
by tracking key hospitality KPIs such as Revenue, ADR, RevPAR, Occupancy Rate,
Week-over-Week (WOW) growth, Month-over-Month (MOM) growth, and Cancellation Rate.
